## BitPoint Network
Bitpoint Network is a decentralised service provider for crypto ATM Businesses powered by Aragon, District0x and Colony. A Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) who's purpose is to develop and manage the infastructure required for a Gobal Decentralised Crypto-Cash Exchange. We will achieve this by aligning our stakeholders intrest with our token BPN

### Mission Statement
"Create a Global Decentralised Crypto-Cash Exchange Network" by making it as easy as possible to setup, manage and finance a crypto ATM business

## Problem 
We believe whole hartedly in the power cryptocurrency has to change our world for the better. Satoshi described bitcoin in his seminal white paper as a "peer to peer electronic cash". However there is still alot of friction moving cash in and out of cryptocurrencies. Over the last few years bitcoin ATMs have sprang up around the world to meet this demand, but the first iteration  of this solution has problems. 

Firstly the cost. Bitcoin ATMs are very expensive. Lamasu's entry model ATM starts at $6000, it is one way (buy only) and currently only supports bitcoin. The high price of the ATM coupled with the technical  know how and volitilty of the assets them selves, makes it difficult for small operators to start ATM businesses. This has lead to only a few companies building networks. The tendency towards centralisation of providers is not just bad from a ideological perspective, but it also inefficient in expanding the cash to crypto service.

## Solution 
Our solution is to dramatically reduce the cost of setting up a ATM business and make running one simple and hassle free.

The first part of our solution is re-designing the ATM user experience, most of the cost of building a crypto ATM Is protecting the cash and checking it is genuine. However most ATMs are located in shops cafes and bars which already have this facility, a cashier and till. The BitPoint terminal separates the user interface and business logic away from handling cash. What is left is a flexible software platform that runs on a Tablet, with a cashier in the loop. This reduces the hardware costs from $6000 to $100 per instillation. Whats more the bitpoint terminal can buy and sell a range of cryptos as opposed to just selling bitcoin.

The second part of our solution is to provide technical support, customer services and marketing for BitPoint terminal operators. This unburdens the operator from the difficulties  of management and allows them to focus on there core business function. 

The third part of our solution is to create a p2p market for financing BitPoint terminal operators by bringing them together with our community members. It can take anywhere between 1 - 7 working days for the cash collected from the customer to be converted back into crypto ready for sale. This means the terminal operators need between 2 - 8 times there expected daily volume locked up for opperations. This is a huge barrier to entry for many potential operators. Our p2p market will connect BitPoint community members with terminal operators allowing them to increase liquidity in the network and unleash the network effects tokenisation enables


## profitibility
From the lamasu website
"Prime locations are reporting monthly transactions volumes from $70K to as high as $300K, standard locations about $20K to $30K. Operators have been covering the cost of their machines in 3-9 months."


## BitPoint Licence 
BitPoint terminal operators pay the DAO a monthly licence fee, this will give operators access to the terminal software and the additional services we provide.

### BitPoint Terminal
The BitPoint terminal is the core of our offering. It runs on a android tablet, it is connected to an exchange and a HotWallet.  It has all the functionality of a regular crypto ATM. Customers can buy and sell any cryptocurrency or token avalable on centralised exchanges. On the back end the software maintains a fiat balance on the exchange and crypto balances in HotWallet there by managing volitilty risk of the crypto assets.

### Services
The licence also covers technical support and customer services via telephone, email and our public channels. Marketing of the brand and indervidual terminals will also be covered by the licence.


## BitPoint Network Token BPN
The BPN token is designed to bootstrap the network and align the incentives of the stake holders. This will enable rapid growth and capture value for the community

### Usage
  - BitPoint Licences will be denominated in BPN.
  - Loans on the funding platform will be collateralised BPN
  - BPN can be staked to terminals providing liquidity
  - BPN holders will pay lower commissions for using the exchange
  - Each token gives 1voting right and one 1 economic right to the DAO

### Distribution
 1.  10% early contributors (presale)
 2.  50% crowd sale (mainsale)
 3.  25% development & opperations (DAO Controlled)
 4.  10% founders (vested 6 months > mainsale)
 5.  4% community bounty 
 5.  1% Airdrop 

### The BitPoint Community 
BitPointNetwork is a community governed organisation. All functions from developing the platform to customer services will be carried out by community members. Additionally crypto communities provide dynamic descussions and wisdom. It is thr community that creates the value, we will return that value back leveraging the infastructure laid down by the Ethereum community 

## The Ethereum Stack
BitPoint Network will be built on a (Ethereum "stack")[https://blog.aragon.one/the-emergent-ethereum-stack-cbce1895142f]. This growing ecosystem allows us to abstract away the functionality these projects provide and focus on building our business. Ethereum is the TCP/IP of the stack it's the Base Layer that makes decentralisation work. In layer two we will use Aragon to create and govern our DAO and Request for accountability, and Colony for management.


### Governance 
The BPN DAO will be powered by Aragon, this allows us to create our tokens, manage token sales, set vesting schedules, manage finances, create bylaws and conduct voting. Aragon provides the DAOs user interface for managers, token holders and other stake holders.

The organisation is owned and governed by its token holders using a liquid democracy governance model. The DAO will not own any physical assets and all its financial transactions will be in Ethereum and Ethereum based tokens. All decisions can be voted on by the organisation including but not limited to 

  - Hiring/firing of employees
  - 
  - Approving budgets
  - Deciding divident percentages and payout frequency 
  - ect
